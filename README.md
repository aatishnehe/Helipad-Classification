# Helipad-Classification
A repository to Identify Helipads using Machine Learning

The folder Jupyter Notebooks contains notebooks for different models. The code can be run directly by just changing the file locations for the dataset and then the trained model should be saved with the given name.

main.py contains the streamlit code which can be used to visualise the machine learning algorithms. If you have saved the trained models with the exact same name as given in the jupyter notebooks, you would only need to change the file path to the saved models and the rest of the code will run without any further modifications.

You can also make use of Conda enviornments. The algorithms are developed using tensorflow, so only the tensorflow env will be sufficient to run the notebook.
