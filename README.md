# Helipad-Classification
A repository to Identify Helipads using Machine Learning

The folder Jupyter Notebooks contains codes for different pretrained models. You can directly run the code just by changin the file locations for the dataset and then save the model with the given name.

main.py contains the streamlit code which can be used to visualise the machine learning algorithms. If you have saved the models with the exact same name as given in the jupyter notebooks, you would only need to change the file path to the saved models and the rest of the code will run without needing any further modifications.

You can also make use of Conda enviornments. The algorithms are developed using tensorflow, so only the tensorflow env will be sufficient to run the code.
